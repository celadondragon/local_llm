Files necessary to create your own local LLM - OFFLINE - on Ubuntu 22.04

Work in progress...

This project aim is to install LLM Engine with GUI and models using two machines.
One is connected to the Internet so you can download necessary applications and files.
The other is offline, it's the one where you can install these applications.

You can use files that are already downloaded in directories (if a distro and architecture matches your own) or you can download the files yourself using this manual.

Let's get started!


First collect instalation files (from this repo or from the links): 

Docker       https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/

LM Studio    https://lmstudio.ai/download

Models       https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
